Bets and number arguments
All of the games in the bot support the same values for bets, as well as the shop and any other command that expects a number as an argument (like /craft).

You can bet using max (or m) to bet your Betting Maximum indicated by /me. You can also buy the maximum number of an item that you can afford, or sell the number of an item that you have using max or m as the count.

If you have less than your betting allowance, it will use all your current cash.

When betting, you can add the following letters after your bet as a shortcut for large numbers.

E.g. 1k = 1,000
y  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
z  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
e  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
p  = 1,000,000,000,000,000
t  = 1,000,000,000,000
g  = 1,000,000,000
m  = 1,000,000
k  = 1,000
All games and commands expect numbers as whole, positive numbers.

Fractional numbers will be rounded down.

Earning money
Cash Commands
The simplest way to earn money in the bot is via the various cash commands.

You can call /work to get some cash every 10 minutes, and /daily every day (resets at midnight regardless of when you called it)

Donators can get access to /overtime as well as /weekly, /monthly and /yearly.

You can see the commands you have access to as well as when they are ready on /cooldowns (/c)

Voting
If you don't mind watching a few ads, you can vote for the bot to get 100,000 x your player level.

Voting consecutively without a gap of more than 48 hours between votes will increase the multiplier.

Each 21st vote will be a 3x multipler, which stacks with your streak multipler.

Assuming you are level 1, the following cash reward table shows what you could receive by chaining votes:

Vote Number	Multipler	Reward
1-20	1x	100,000
21	3x	300,000
22 - 41	2x	200,000
42	6x	600,000
43 - 62	3x	300,000
63	9x	900,000
64 - 83	4x	400,000
84	12x	1,200,000
